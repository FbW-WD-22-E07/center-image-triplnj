# center-image
## center image using the way you like:

- make a nice navbar the way you like, its ok to copy from make-nav if you dont have time.
- under the nave you should have a section ocupying the entire width and 80% of viewport height.
- section should have a background color.
- inside the section you should have a landscape image.
- image should have maximum 80% width of the section. 
- center the image inside the section perfectly.
- give the image a nice dark border.
- you might use object-fit to place the image inside img nicely.
- give the image a tooltip the easy way.
- bonos: use hover effect to make the image little bit bigger without affecting other elements.
